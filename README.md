Modify yourdomain.com/wp-login.php to yourdomain.com/login. I made this plug-in for myself and I think it will be useful to you.

== Description ==

A simple plugin that will help you to modify your base wp links. It can change yourdomain.com/wp-login.php to yourdomain.com/login, yourdomain.com/wp-login.php?action=register to yourdomain.com/register and yourdomain.com/wp-login.php?action=lostpassword to yourdomain.com/forgot. There is no additional setup in admin menu. Just activate the plugin and enjoy.

Does it have any extended tab for configuration?
No, just activate the plugin and you are done! But I am thinking for extending it's functionality. If you want to join me for further development contact me at "theme.guardians [at] gmail [dot] com" or get me on github "https://github.com/Kalmax1985/Modify-WP-Links".
